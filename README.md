R Scripts used for simulations in Miyashita et al (2015): PLOS Biology 13(3): e1002094. doi:10.1371/ journal.pbio.1002094.
Just copying & pasting the scripts to R console is enough to run simulations. For S1, S2, S3, S6, S9 and S10 Text, slight modifications were done from the originally published scripts, in order to shorten simulation time and/or to avoid errors that may occur depending on R versions. These modifications do not affect the simulation results.
